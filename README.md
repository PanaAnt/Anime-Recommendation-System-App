## Anime Recommendation System Web-App
I created this recommendation app intended to be deployed, however, the financial cost to run and host the server even if there are minimal amount of users is not sustainable for me. However, I plan to turn the actual recommendation system into a discord bot for community servers to use, I have already been requested by some communities to do so. When I have made it I will share the link to the bot on this github page. I have not set this web-app up in a way for people to copy and run themselves, as I believe it would be more functional as a discord bot for communities to use easily rather than an obscure website. However, deploying is still on the table and I will do so when possible.
